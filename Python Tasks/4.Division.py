integer = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
divisor = int(input("Please enter a divisor: "))

answer = integer // divisor #Calculates the answer in integer form.
remainder = integer % divisor #Calculates the remainder.

print(answer, "remainder", remainder)

#Doesn't match the example but I think the example is wrong...
